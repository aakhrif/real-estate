## Reactive Forms
### We Are going to use Reactive forms instead of Template driven as they:
1. Provide direct, explicit access to the underlying form's object model.
2. Compared to template-driven forms, they are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. 
3. If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.
